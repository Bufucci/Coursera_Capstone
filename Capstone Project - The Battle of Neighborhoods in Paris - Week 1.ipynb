    "## 1. Introduction : Discussion & Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**New Business Locations for High Traffic & best suitable Areas in Paris France.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Task in Hand :**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make data-driven decisions on Paris neighborhoods, locations that are most suitable for certain specified activities - we will specify our prefences later the way we are curious. This will be a major part of our decision-making process, the other being on the ground qualitative analysis of districts once this data and report are reviewed and studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Giving our project a clear objective, we will be looking for high traffic areas or hot spots where consumers go for shopping, restaurants and entertainment. Moreover, we will seek for areas where Tourists spend most time in order to narrow our perimeter of research for higher level of density. Foursquare data will be very helpful in making data-driven decisions about where located the best of those areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Criteria :**\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking for the best locations for high traffic, can be similar to looking for areas where people usully got out to, or frequently use. Thus we can suggest to look for such locations in order to seek high trafic for a specified activity, Clothing Stores as an example, or any other activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data will strongly suggest that the best places are in fact areas that are near French Restaurants, Coffee shops and Wine Bars. Parisians are very social people that frequent these place often, so seeking high trafic in these locations is  something to consider and expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can also think to target location know for Artistic Activities of which Paris is of high repution, these location can also be where most tourist spend their time as they are the best to see and frequent. This can help us getting even higher levels of Trafic for certain activities. This process can get us curius to check the density of trending areas within each neighborhood of Paris city, which can lead us to explore Trending spots using the Foursquare API, if possible or other data in order to get insights about density of Neighborhoods of our research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis and recommendations for best suitable location for high trafic and hot spots for certain activity of our choice will focus on general districts with these establishments, not on specific addresses. Narrowing down the best district options derived from analysis allows for either further research to be conducted as well as advising who is concerned with the business of the chosen district.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Data ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Without leveraging data to make decisions about where to seek high traffic areas locations,  one could spend countless hours walking around districts, consulting many real estate agents with their own district biases, and end up in yet another location that is not ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data will provide better answers and better solutions to this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outcomes :**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to identify the best districts - Arrondissements - to seek or choose for certain activities. The results will be translated in a simple form that will convey the data-driven analysis for the best locations for specified activities.\n",

    "## 2 . The Data Science Workflow : \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Requirements :**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main districts in Paris are divided into 20 Arrondissements Municipaux (administrative districts), shortened to arrondissements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data regarding the districts in Paris needs to be researched and a suitable useable source identified. If it is found but is not in a useable form, data wrangling and cleaning will have to be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleansed data will then be used alongside Foursquare data, which is readily available. Foursquare location data will be leveraged to explore or compare districts around Paris, identifying the high traffic areas where consumers go for shopping, dining and entertainment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Data Science Workflow for Part 1 includes the following :**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outline the initial data that is required : District data for Paris including names, location data if available, and any other details required.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Obtain the Data :\n",
    "    - Research and find suitable sources for the district data for Paris.\n",
    "    - Access and explore the data to determine if it can be manipulated for our purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initial Data Wrangling and Cleaning: Clean the data and convert to a useable form as a dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Data Science Workflow for Part 2 includes the following :**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Analysis and Location Data :\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Foursquare location data will be leveraged to explore or compare districts around Paris.\n",
    "    - Data manipulation and analysis to derive subsets of the initial data.\n",
    "    - Identifying the high traffic areas, trending venues and the more suitable locations for certaine activities using data visualisation and statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualization :\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Analysis and plotting visualizations.\n",
    "    - Data visualization using various mapping libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discussion and Conclusions :\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Recomendations and results based on the data analysis.\n",
    "    - Discussion of any limitations and how the results can be used, and any conclusions that can be drawn."
